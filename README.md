# mini-mvc
A very simple MVC framework for PHP.

# about
This is a bare-bones MVC framework I built to mainly to learn, but also to use for my personal websites. The point is basically to be able to build a website with an MVC architecture very quickly. I plan to add new features as I use the framework and realize things it may need or things that may be useful.
