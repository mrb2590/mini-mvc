# mini-mvc
A very simple MVC framework for PHP.

# about
This is a bare-bones MVC framework I built to mainly to learn, but also to use for my personal websites. The point is basically to be able to build a website with an MVC architecture very quickly. I plan to add new features as I use the framework and realize things it may need or things that may be useful.

#things I plan to add
* Have the get, post, and param vars sanitized. Maybe in the Request class
* Make a MySQL and/or Mongo wrapper class for the framework
* Possibly make some type of object mapper for models
* Allow a route to have mutile request methods
 * Right now you would have to make two routes, one for GET and one for POST
